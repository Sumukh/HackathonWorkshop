1. What is a hackathon?
-----------------------
A hackathon is usually a 24-48 event where you (and your team) set to build something cool - with either hardware or software. At the end, you demo your project to the sponsors/audience/judges. Usually you end up with a prototype of a product, learn a lot, and possibly win some prizes. The usual rules are: teams of upto 4, code should be written at the event (open-source/libraries are fine), there might be special prize categories, using APIs is encouraged.

There will be a lot of food/snacks - be sure to enjoy it & drink lots of water. Contarary to popular belief - You shouldn't stay up the whole time - it's okay to sleep/take a nap. 

2. The Idea
------------------------
It's worth spending time to think of an idea that everyone on your team wants to work on. 

How to choose ideas:

In general you want to build something that will leave people amazed and wondering "how did they do that?". The more futuristic the better - building things that excite/impress people is the best way to stand out. 
Another approach is to build something that's a personal pain point. 

A good approach to thinking of hackathon ideas is to think of the pitch first. The important thing to think about is how will you demo it and what will people care about? Then set out to only build the parts that people will care about. So it won't really matter if you made the most interesting backend system or tech stack using twelve programming languages (that would be neat though) - people won't care if that's not the core of your application. 

It's important to think about what you want to get out of it - it's okay not to be focused on getting a prize. 
If you just want to build something you think would be cool - go for it. If you just want to learn something - go for it.
